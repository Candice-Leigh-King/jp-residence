    <p>Located in a quiet suburb approximately 10 minutes by car from Vientiane city center, youâ€™ll find JP Residences. Known as a hidden gem to those residing on the property of the impressive six-story apartment building for outstanding service and fully-furnished apartments.<br><br>
    The well-equipped gym and outside area contribute to the peaceful atmosphere of JP Residences while each unit has a private balcony overlooking some measure of lush Lao vegitation. Not to mention, the undercover parking lot which provides space for all vehicle types.<br><br>
    Built for expatriates seeking comfort and safety abroad, each unit has a smoke detector and every floor is equipped with a fire alarm and fire extinguishers. We also have CCTV cameras around the property and two on each floor. At JP Residences we pride ourselves in offering you the safest, cleanest and most comfortable place to call home.

With our receptionist, tenants can also arrange laundry servicing and drinking water.

      All staff at JP Residences say hello and smile whenever they meet my baby. My young baby can play outside well because of safe garden, facilities, and kind staff. And also, there is a clean gym we can enjoy. The views from the rooms are very nice! We've been in Laos for 8 years and this is the best partment we've stayed in. <br>

          JP Residencess is a wonderful place to call home. The apartments are well designed and come with loads of modern touches. The management and staff are friendly and have quickly addressed any problems we have had (which have been minimal!). The building is incredibly well maintained and always seems immaculately clean. <br>

           My wife and I have stayed at a few different apartments around Vientiane as we battled to find a place that meets all our needs. JP Residences has done so. The rooms are modern and well kept. There is always staff around that are able to help and attend to us if need be. The facilities are great: a well equipped fitness centre, grass area and huge undercover parking. My wife and I were very pleased to have drinking water available. Also the location is perfect, close to downtown in the heart of the expat area, but also on an extremely quiet road. Overall we have been very happy here and would recommend these apartments without hesitation. <br>
